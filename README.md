## Motif_mark Problem ~ Bi610 


## Background

MBNL1 and RBFOX1 are both regualtors of alternative splicing and they happen to regulate splcing in similar manners. Both are activators/suppresors of exon-inclusion for pre-mRNA splicing. 

## Question:
How does MBNL1 and RBFOX1 work together to regulate alternative splicing events in various transcripts that are regulated by both?

## Answer:
To answer this question, I developed a Python script to plot protein binding motifs on an SVG image using pycairo given exon and flanking intron positions. 
In the corresponding folders in this repository, you can find the two FASTA files I used to iterate through while also factoring in the 'motifs' list of interest (some need to be referenced from the IUPAC site given the base_ambiguity. Two example SVG output images are also uploaded to reference the output one should get when running the script.
